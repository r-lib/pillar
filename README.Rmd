pillar provides tools for styling columns of data, artfully using colour and unicode characters to guide the eye.


## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# pillar is installed if you install the tidyverse package:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just pillar:
install.packages("pillar")
```


## Usage

pillar is a developer-facing package that is not designed for end-users.
It powers the `print()` and `format()` methods for [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/)s.
It also and defines generics and helpers that are useful for package authors who create custom vector classes (see https://github.com/krlmlr/awesome-vctrs#readme for examples) or custom table classes (like [dbplyr](https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/) or [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/)).

```{r}
library(pillar)

x <- 123456789 * (10^c(-3, -5, NA, -8, -10))
pillar(x)

tbl_format_setup(tibble::tibble(x))
```

## Custom vector classes

The primary user of this package is [tibble](https://github.com/tidyverse/tibble), which lets pillar do all the formatting work.
Packages that implement a data type to be used in a tibble column can customize the display by implementing a `pillar_shaft()` method.

```{r}
library(pillar)

percent <- vctrs::new_vctr(9:11 * 0.01, class = "percent")

pillar_shaft.percent <- function(x, ...) {
  fmt <- format(vctrs::vec_data(x) * 100)
  new_pillar_shaft_simple(paste0(fmt, " ", style_subtle("%")), align = "right")
}

pillar(percent)
```

See `vignette("pillar", package = "vctrs")` for details.


## Custom table classes

pillar provides various extension points for customizing how a tibble-like class is printed.

```{r}
tbl <- vctrs::new_data_frame(list(a = 1:3), class = c("my_tbl", "tbl"))

tbl_sum.my_tbl <- function(x, ...) {
  c("Hello" = "world!")
}

tbl
```

See `vignette("extending", package = "pillar")` for a walkthrough of the options.
