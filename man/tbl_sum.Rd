\usage{
tbl_sum(x, ...)

\item{x}{Object to summarise.}

\item{...}{Unused, for extensibility.}

\value{
A named character vector, describing the dimensions in the first element
and the data source in the name of the first element.
}
\description{
\code{tbl_sum()} gives a brief textual description of a table-like object,
which should include the dimensions and the data source in the first element,
and additional information in the other elements (such as grouping for \pkg{dplyr}).
The default implementation forwards to \code{\link[=obj_sum]{obj_sum()}}.

This generic will be moved to \pkg{pillar}, and reexported from there
as soon as it becomes available.
